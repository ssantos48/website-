<P>In his childhood, he learned clarinet, which he later abandoned after he decided to start singing. When he went to college, he took singing classes and sang in front of his friends. He also was in the college choir. He finally focused on making reggaeton music. He also sang at college parties, birthday parties, and reunions. He prefers hip-hop and R&B and follows artists like Drake, T-Pain, and Chris Brown, but he became a reggaeton artist because he felt that it was more popular with younger generations.He has recently worked with several well-known artists like J Balvin and Sebasti√°n Yatra.
